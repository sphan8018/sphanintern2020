       <p><font size="5">  In my internship on the Digital Team of the Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices, I have a huge chance to learn new things and to discover my ability to analyzing data and website usage based on the techniques that I have studied in the University of Maryland. In adapting to the information technology environment, my internship routine involved working on migration of the Treasury.gov page, analyzing data and the creation of web forms for code.gov. IN addition, my duties included learning some coding languages such as HTML and CSS. My internship opened my mind about my career in the future very much because I now know that I am able to work in diverse fields which require analytical skills. </font></p>

It included content, documents, links, and in some cases, email addresses. This job required accurately following the procedure 100%. After migrating, the tickets would be moved to the progress boxes, where they would be checked by other team members. <br>
<br><font size="5" color="#FF9966">Checking the qualified checklist:</font> a team member would be assigned to check the content to make sure all of data were migrated correctly, and there weren’t any trashed tags and no mistakes were made. A ticket had to go through more than a twenty point’s checklist before moving to higher level checking, then it could be published.

<p> <H4> What I Gained From My Internship</H4></p>
<p> <font size="5" color="#FF9966">How the Internship Relates to My Career Aspirations</font></p>
<p> <font size="5">To be a Federal employee is my dream because I want to give back to the country. And, the internship gave me the first insight into federal jobs. I learned trained to adapt to a professional environment and many federal standards and procedures. Moreover, the internship helped me to explore my analytical ability analysis which made me more confident of attaining my targeted future career as a “data analyst”. I realized that my career goal is not limited to Economics fields, and that I can easily handle other fields with my logical mind. I am now inspired to step out into the labor market to take the best for myself. In contrast, the internship did not relate to my academic goals much because most of my activities related to computer sciences rather than to economics, which is my major. It worked in the programming and IT office, but for a federal agency with an economic mission. So those skills that I gained in this internship were great, but only distantly related to economic analysis.  </font></p>

  <div class="container">
<p><font size="5" color="#FF9966">How the Internship Aligned with my Original Expectations</font></p>
    <p> <font size="5">If I divided my goal expectations of this internship into four parts: academic learning, career development, skills development, and personal development, I would evaluate it as more than 85%. It related only a little to my academic training, as my major is Economics. However, I used and developed analytical skills during my most of my time in this internship. I think that I achieved more than 50% of my original expectation in terms of learning. This is the only one objection that I can raise about my internship. Three aspects: career development, skills development, and personal development exceeded my original expectations, which together make me more confident about joining the labor market after graduating. I got great benefits from skills development in this intern. I can now use more tools such as Python or other software which can help me to do many jobs more efficiently. Moreover, in terms of personal development, the internship helped me to get out of my comfort zone. I learned to not be afraid of speaking out in front of many people. I learned to handle telephone meetings without being nervous. My internship in the digital team was great although it just lasted about six weeks.  Besides, I got shadowing experience with some experts who had worked in their fields more than 10 years. For example, Johnathan who has worked as a web designer with HTML and CSS in digital team for 15 years. The internship opened my mind about my future career very well.</font></p>
