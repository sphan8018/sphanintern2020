<p> <H4> Internship with Me</H4></p>
<p> <font size="5" color="#FF9966">How the Internship relate to my career aspirations</font></p>
<p> <font size="7">To be a Federal employee is my dream because I want to contribute for the country. And, the internship gave me the first sight of the Federal job. I was trained to adapt a professional environment which used many standards of procedures. Moreover, the internship helped me to explore my ability of analysis which made me more confident with my target career in the future as “Data analyst”. I realized that my analysis goal future career is not only within the Economics fields, but I can easily handle in other fields with my logical mind. No threshold, no impediment, I am now full of energy to step out to the labor market to take the best for myself. In the contrast, the internship did not relate my academic goals too much because most of my activities related to computer sciences rather than economics, which is my major. It is in the programming and IT office, so those skills that I will gain in this internship can be great, but economics analysis can be very limited in this internship.  </font></p>
</div>   
    
  <div class="container">
<p><font size="5" color="#FF9966">How the Internship with my original expectations</font></p>
    <p> <font size="7"> If I divided my goal expectations of this internship into four parts: academic learning, career development, skills development, and personal development, it would be evaluated more than 85%. There are not much academic learning which my major is Economics. However, analysis was used in my most time in this internship. Comparison between lost and benefit, I think that I can get more than 50% of my original expectation in academy learning term. This is the only one objective that I can raise in my internship period. Three subjects: career development, skills development, and personal development are more than my original expectation, which support each other to make me more confident to join in the labor market after graduating. I got great benefits from the skills development in this intern. Analysis technique can use some tools such as Python or any software’s which can help me to do my jobs much efficiency. Moreover, the personal development helped me to get out of my comfort zone which I got afraid of speaking out in front of many people. I could handle telephone meeting without nervous. I can tell that my internship in the digital team was great although it just spent about 6 weeks. Besides, I got some shadow experience with some expert who worked in their fields more than 10 years. For example, Johnathan who has worked as a web designer with HTML and CSS in digital team for 15 years. The internship opened my mind about my future career very well.  </font>/</p>
